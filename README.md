# Restaurant Reviews App Project

## Project Overview
Static webpage was converted to a mobile-ready web application. 
Starter repository: https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1

Features added: 
- responsive design (responsive.css, styles.css)
- accessibility (index.html, restaurant.html, main.js, restaurant_info.js)
- availability (sw.js, main.js)

## Running the project
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. In project folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software. For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.
3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
